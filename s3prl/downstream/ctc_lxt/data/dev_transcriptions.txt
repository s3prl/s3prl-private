squad-572a11663f37b31900478693-c-1 A NINETEEN NINETY SIX STUDY BY PEROTTI EXAMINED THE CHANNELS THROUGH WHICH INEQUALITY MAY AFFECT ECONOMIC GROWTH
squad-572a11663f37b31900478693-c-2 HE SHOWED THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CREDIT MARKET IMPERFECTION APPROACH INEQUALITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER LEVEL OF HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION EDUCATION EXPERIENCE AND APPRENTICESHIP AND HIGHER LEVEL OF FERTILITY AND THEREBY LOWER LEVELS OF GROWTH
squad-572a11663f37b31900478693-c-3 HE FOUND THAT INEQUALITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF REDISTRIBUTIVE TAXATION WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER LEVELS OF GROWTH FROM REDUCTIONS IN PRIVATE SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT
squad-572a11663f37b31900478693-c-4 PEROTTI CONCLUDED THAT MORE EQUAL SOCIETIES HAVE LOWER FERTILITY RATES AND HIGHER RATES OF INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION

squad-5ad4e3a15b96ef001a10a562-c-2 WHEN A PART OF A PLANT BECOMES INFECTED THE PLANT PRODUCES A LOCALIZED HYPERSENSITIVE RESPONSE WHEREBY CELLS AT THE SITE OF INFECTION UNDERGO RAPID APOPTOSIS TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE TO OTHER PARTS OF THE PLANT
squad-5ad4e3a15b96ef001a10a562-c-3 SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED RESISTANCE SAR IS A TYPE OF DEFENSIVE RESPONSE USED BY PLANTS THAT RENDERS THE ENTIRE PLANT RESISTANT TO A PARTICULAR INFECTIOUS AGENT
squad-5ad4e3a15b96ef001a10a562-c-4 RNA SILENCING MECHANISMS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN THIS SYSTEMIC RESPONSE AS THEY CAN BLOCK VIRUS REPLICATION

squad-572998673f37b319004784d5-c-0 THE EVOLUTIONARY STRATEGY USED BY CICADAS OF THE GENUS MAGICICADA MAKE USE OF PRIME NUMBERS
squad-572998673f37b319004784d5-c-1 THESE INSECTS SPEND MOST OF THEIR LIVES AS GRUBS UNDERGROUND
squad-572998673f37b319004784d5-c-2 THEY ONLY PUPATE AND THEN EMERGE FROM THEIR BURROWS AFTER SEVEN THIRTEEN OR SEVENTEEN YEARS AT WHICH POINT THEY FLY ABOUT BREED AND THEN DIE AFTER A FEW WEEKS AT MOST
squad-572998673f37b319004784d5-c-3 THE LOGIC FOR THIS IS BELIEVED TO BE THAT THE PRIME NUMBER INTERVALS BETWEEN EMERGENCES MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR PREDATORS TO EVOLVE THAT COULD SPECIALIZE AS PREDATORS ON MAGICICADAS
squad-572998673f37b319004784d5-c-4 IF MAGICICADAS APPEARED AT A NON PRIME NUMBER INTERVALS SAY EVERY TWELVE YEARS THEN PREDATORS APPEARING EVERY TWO THREE FOUR SIX OR TWELVE YEARS WOULD BE SURE TO MEET THEM
squad-572998673f37b319004784d5-c-5 OVER A TWO HUNDRED YEAR PERIOD AVERAGE PREDATOR POPULATIONS DURING HYPOTHETICAL OUTBREAKS OF FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR CICADAS WOULD BE UP TO TWO PERCENT HIGHER THAN DURING OUTBREAKS OF THIRTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR CICADAS
squad-572998673f37b319004784d5-c-6 THOUGH SMALL THIS ADVANTAGE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO DRIVE NATURAL SELECTION IN FAVOUR OF A PRIME NUMBERED LIFE CYCLE FOR THESE INSECTS
squad-572998673f37b319004784d5-q-0 WHAT TYPE OF INSECT EMPLOYS THE USE OF PRIME NUMBERS IN ITS EVOLUTIONARY STRATEGY
squad-5ad4e4425b96ef001a10a573-c-0 ANOTHER IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS TO IDENTIFY AND ELIMINATE TUMORS
squad-5ad4e4425b96ef001a10a573-c-1 THIS IS CALLED IMMUNE SURVEILLANCE
squad-5ad4e4425b96ef001a10a573-c-2 THE TRANSFORMED CELLS OF TUMORS EXPRESS ANTIGENS THAT ARE NOT FOUND ON NORMAL CELLS
squad-5ad4e4425b96ef001a10a573-c-3 TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM THESE ANTIGENS APPEAR FOREIGN AND THEIR PRESENCE CAUSES IMMUNE CELLS TO ATTACK THE TRANSFORMED TUMOR CELLS
squad-5ad4e4425b96ef001a10a573-c-4 THE ANTIGENS EXPRESSED BY TUMORS HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES SOME ARE DERIVED FROM ONCOGENIC VIRUSES LIKE HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS WHICH CAUSES CERVICAL CANCER WHILE OTHERS ARE THE ORGANISM'S OWN PROTEINS THAT OCCUR AT LOW LEVELS IN NORMAL CELLS BUT REACH HIGH LEVELS IN TUMOR CELLS
squad-5ad4e4425b96ef001a10a573-c-5 ONE EXAMPLE IS AN ENZYME CALLED TYROSINASE THAT WHEN EXPRESSED AT HIGH LEVELS TRANSFORMS CERTAIN SKIN CELLS E G MELANOCYTES INTO TUMORS CALLED MELANOMAS
squad-5ad4e4425b96ef001a10a573-c-6 A THIRD POSSIBLE SOURCE OF TUMOR ANTIGENS ARE PROTEINS NORMALLY IMPORTANT FOR REGULATING CELL GROWTH AND SURVIVAL THAT COMMONLY MUTATE INTO CANCER INDUCING MOLECULES CALLED ONCOGENES

squad-5ad3a16d604f3c001a3fe9e3-c-0 IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE SIX COLONIAL GOVERNORS IN NORTH AMERICA MET WITH GENERAL EDWARD BRADDOCK THE NEWLY ARRIVED BRITISH ARMY COMMANDER AND PLANNED A FOUR WAY ATTACK ON THE FRENCH
squad-5ad3a16d604f3c001a3fe9e3-c-1 NONE SUCCEEDED AND THE MAIN EFFORT BY BRADDOCK WAS A DISASTER HE WAS DEFEATED IN THE BATTLE OF THE MONONGAHELA ON JULY NINE SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE AND DIED A FEW DAYS LATER
squad-5ad3a16d604f3c001a3fe9e3-c-2 BRITISH OPERATIONS IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE SEVENTEEN FIFTY SIX AND SEVENTEEN FIFTY SEVEN IN THE FRONTIER AREAS OF PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW YORK ALL FAILED DUE TO A COMBINATION OF POOR MANAGEMENT INTERNAL DIVISIONS AND EFFECTIVE CANADIAN SCOUTS FRENCH REGULAR FORCES AND INDIAN WARRIOR ALLIES
squad-5ad3a16d604f3c001a3fe9e3-c-3 IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE THE BRITISH CAPTURED FORT BEAUSEJOUR ON THE BORDER SEPARATING NOVA SCOTIA FROM ACADIA SOON AFTERWARD THEY ORDERED THE EXPULSION OF THE ACADIANS
squad-5ad3a16d604f3c001a3fe9e3-c-4 ORDERS FOR THE DEPORTATION WERE GIVEN BY WILLIAM SHIRLEY COMMANDER IN CHIEF NORTH AMERICA WITHOUT DIRECTION FROM GREAT BRITAIN
squad-5ad3a16d604f3c001a3fe9e3-c-5 THE ACADIANS BOTH THOSE CAPTURED IN ARMS AND THOSE WHO HAD SWORN THE LOYALTY OATH TO HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY WERE EXPELLED

squad-5ad5344b5b96ef001a10ab88-c-0 CLOSELY RELATED FIELDS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE ARE ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS AND COMPUTABILITY THEORY
squad-5ad5344b5b96ef001a10ab88-c-1 A KEY DISTINCTION BETWEEN ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS AND COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY THEORY IS THAT THE FORMER IS DEVOTED TO ANALYZING THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES NEEDED BY A PARTICULAR ALGORITHM TO SOLVE A PROBLEM WHEREAS THE LATTER ASKS A MORE GENERAL QUESTION ABOUT ALL POSSIBLE ALGORITHMS THAT COULD BE USED TO SOLVE THE SAME PROBLEM
squad-5ad5344b5b96ef001a10ab88-c-2 MORE PRECISELY IT TRIES TO CLASSIFY PROBLEMS THAT CAN OR CANNOT BE SOLVED WITH APPROPRIATELY RESTRICTED RESOURCES
squad-5ad5344b5b96ef001a10ab88-c-3 IN TURN IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY FROM COMPUTABILITY THEORY THE LATTER THEORY ASKS WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS CAN IN PRINCIPLE BE SOLVED ALGORITHMICALLY

squad-5ad24840d7d075001a428b5f-c-0 AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE CREATION OF INEQUALITY IS VARIATION IN INDIVIDUALS' ACCESS TO EDUCATION
squad-5ad24840d7d075001a428b5f-c-1 EDUCATION ESPECIALLY IN AN AREA WHERE THERE IS A HIGH DEMAND FOR WORKERS CREATES HIGH WAGES FOR THOSE WITH THIS EDUCATION HOWEVER INCREASES IN EDUCATION FIRST INCREASE AND THEN DECREASE GROWTH AS WELL AS INCOME INEQUALITY
squad-5ad24840d7d075001a428b5f-c-2 AS A RESULT THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE TO AFFORD AN EDUCATION OR CHOOSE NOT TO PURSUE OPTIONAL EDUCATION GENERALLY RECEIVE MUCH LOWER WAGES
squad-5ad24840d7d075001a428b5f-c-3 THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS IS THAT A LACK OF EDUCATION LEADS DIRECTLY TO LOWER INCOMES AND THUS LOWER AGGREGATE SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT
squad-5ad24840d7d075001a428b5f-c-4 CONVERSELY EDUCATION RAISES INCOMES AND PROMOTES GROWTH BECAUSE IT HELPS TO UNLEASH THE PRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL OF THE POOR

squad-5acff00c77cf76001a6865b6-c-4 U S DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT GATES CALLED FOR ESTABLISHING SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE DEFUNCT U S INFORMATION AGENCY WHICH WAS CHARGED WITH UNDERMINING THE COMMUNIST IDEOLOGY DURING THE COLD WAR
squad-573010fab2c2fd14005687db-c-0 THESE ATTACKS RESONATED WITH CONSERVATIVE MUSLIMS AND THE PROBLEM DID NOT GO AWAY WITH SADDAM'S DEFEAT EITHER SINCE AMERICAN TROOPS REMAINED STATIONED IN THE KINGDOM AND A DE FACTO COOPERATION WITH THE PALESTINIAN ISRAELI PEACE PROCESS DEVELOPED

quac-C_6ddf50a14de94ac9991786264f48a22f_0_q#5-c-2 IT IS NOT KNOWING THAT GOVERNS ETHICAL ACTIONS BUT FEELINGS

quac-C_6ddf50a14de94ac9991786264f48a22f_0_q#5-c-4 REASON ITSELF IS UTTERLY IMPOTENT IN THIS PARTICULAR
quac-C_6ddf50a14de94ac9991786264f48a22f_0_q#5-c-5 THE RULES OF MORALITY THEREFORE ARE NOT CONCLUSIONS OF OUR REASON
quac-C_6ddf50a14de94ac9991786264f48a22f_0_q#5-c-6 HUME'S SENTIMENTALISM ABOUT MORALITY WAS SHARED BY HIS CLOSE FRIEND ADAM SMITH AND HUME AND SMITH WERE MUTUALLY INFLUENCED BY THE MORAL REFLECTIONS OF THEIR OLDER CONTEMPORARY FRANCIS HUTCHESON

quac-C_6ddf50a14de94ac9991786264f48a22f_0_q#5-c-10 HUME DEMANDS THAT A REASON SHOULD BE GIVEN FOR INFERRING WHAT OUGHT TO BE THE CASE FROM WHAT IS THE CASE
quac-C_6ddf50a14de94ac9991786264f48a22f_0_q#5-c-11 THIS BECAUSE IT SEEMS ALTOGETHER INCONCEIVABLE HOW THIS NEW RELATION CAN BE A DEDUCTION FROM OTHERS

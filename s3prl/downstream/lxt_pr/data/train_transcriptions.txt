squad-5ad4a110ba00c4001a268e61-c-0 THE IMMUNE SYSTEM PROTECTS ORGANISMS FROM INFECTION WITH LAYERED DEFENSES OF INCREASING SPECIFICITY
squad-5ad4a110ba00c4001a268e61-c-1 IN SIMPLE TERMS PHYSICAL BARRIERS PREVENT PATHOGENS SUCH AS BACTERIA AND VIRUSES FROM ENTERING THE ORGANISM
squad-5ad4a110ba00c4001a268e61-c-2 IF A PATHOGEN BREACHES THESE BARRIERS THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM PROVIDES AN IMMEDIATE BUT NON SPECIFIC RESPONSE
squad-5ad4a110ba00c4001a268e61-c-3 INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEMS ARE FOUND IN ALL PLANTS AND ANIMALS
squad-5ad4a110ba00c4001a268e61-c-4 IF PATHOGENS SUCCESSFULLY EVADE THE INNATE RESPONSE VERTEBRATES POSSESS A SECOND LAYER OF PROTECTION THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM WHICH IS ACTIVATED BY THE INNATE RESPONSE
squad-5ad4a110ba00c4001a268e61-c-5 HERE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM ADAPTS ITS RESPONSE DURING AN INFECTION TO IMPROVE ITS RECOGNITION OF THE PATHOGEN
squad-5ad4a110ba00c4001a268e61-c-6 THIS IMPROVED RESPONSE IS THEN RETAINED AFTER THE PATHOGEN HAS BEEN ELIMINATED IN THE FORM OF AN IMMUNOLOGICAL MEMORY AND ALLOWS THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO MOUNT FASTER AND STRONGER ATTACKS EACH TIME THIS PATHOGEN IS ENCOUNTERED

squad-5729da0faf94a219006aa676-c-0 A JOB WHERE THERE ARE MANY WORKERS WILLING TO WORK A LARGE AMOUNT OF TIME HIGH SUPPLY COMPETING FOR A JOB THAT FEW REQUIRE LOW DEMAND WILL RESULT IN A LOW WAGE FOR THAT JOB
squad-5729da0faf94a219006aa676-c-1 THIS IS BECAUSE COMPETITION BETWEEN WORKERS DRIVES DOWN THE WAGE
squad-5729da0faf94a219006aa676-c-2 AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE JOBS SUCH AS DISH WASHING OR CUSTOMER SERVICE
squad-5729da0faf94a219006aa676-c-3 COMPETITION AMONGST WORKERS TENDS TO DRIVE DOWN WAGES DUE TO THE EXPENDABLE NATURE OF THE WORKER IN RELATION TO HIS OR HER PARTICULAR JOB
squad-5729da0faf94a219006aa676-c-4 A JOB WHERE THERE ARE FEW ABLE OR WILLING WORKERS LOW SUPPLY BUT A LARGE NEED FOR THE POSITIONS HIGH DEMAND WILL RESULT IN HIGH WAGES FOR THAT JOB
squad-5729da0faf94a219006aa676-c-5 THIS IS BECAUSE COMPETITION BETWEEN EMPLOYERS FOR EMPLOYEES WILL DRIVE UP THE WAGE
squad-5729da0faf94a219006aa676-c-6 EXAMPLES OF THIS WOULD INCLUDE JOBS THAT REQUIRE HIGHLY DEVELOPED SKILLS RARE ABILITIES OR A HIGH LEVEL OF RISK
squad-5729da0faf94a219006aa676-c-7 COMPETITION AMONGST EMPLOYERS TENDS TO DRIVE UP WAGES DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE JOB SINCE THERE IS A RELATIVE SHORTAGE OF WORKERS FOR THE PARTICULAR POSITION
